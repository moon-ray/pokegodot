A side project I'm working on just for fun. The code is not intended for actual use in making Pok√©mon games yet, as it is incredibly messy and unfinished.

This is built off of my old project, which was a turn based fighting game featuring some of my real life friends; it may have graphics leftover from that game.

I'm trying to make it like Gen 1, mainly with improvements from Gen 2 and 3.

No documentation of how the code works. Figure it out for yourself for now. Maybe in the future there will be; but knowing me, probably not.
