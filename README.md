#

A side project I'm working on just for fun. The code is not intended for actual use in making Pokémon games yet, as it is incredibly messy and unfinished.

This is built off of my old project, which was a turn based fighting game featuring some of my real life friends; it may have graphics leftover from that game.

I'm trying to make it like Gen 1, mainly with improvements from Gen 2 and 3.

No documentation of how the code works. Figure it out for yourself for now. Maybe in the future there will be; but knowing me, probably not.

# CONTAINS ASSETS OWNED BY GAMEFREAK AND NINTENDO!!

Some assets are either modified from the original Pokémon Red and Blue or Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal; or are ripped straight from said games.

This includes audio, sprites and music.

None of these assets ripped from original Pokémon games are owned by me. I do not intend to make any profit from these assets.
